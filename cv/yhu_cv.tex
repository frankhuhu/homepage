{\em Research Assistant} \hfill {\bf 2013.7 - present}\\
Research on designing a light-weighted record and replay tool for 
event-driven mobile system. The current target is Android. Traditional 
whole system replay tools are too heavy-weighted and not suitable for 
mobile devices. Our insight is that we could capture only a portion 
of the events that are enough for reproducting event-driven concurrent 
bugs.

{\em Software Engineer} \hfill {\bf 2010.4 - 2012.7}\\
Member of Binary Translation Team, SSG. I join the "Houdini" project.
"Houdini" is a dynamic binary translator that translates Arm code to 
x86. It allows Android applications which contain native Arm code to 
seamlessly run on x86 devices. My main job is to develope tools to ensure 
product quality and performance. I have developed a code/path coverage 
tool to provide metrics of the software quality. The performance tool 
is based on sampling and instrumentation techniques to detect and 
breakdown the overhead of the product.
